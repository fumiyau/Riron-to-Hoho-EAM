Replication files for my paper on educational assortative mating (Assortative Mating in the Age of Marriage Decline)

There are 9 do files (+master fofile) to run the replication.

0.Master.do - a do file that runs other do files

1.Dataconst - a do file that creates dataset for analysis

2.Desc.do - a do file that submits descriptive statistics

3.Analysis.do - a do file that examines the multivariate analysis

4.Prediction-c3.do through 9.Prediction-c5obs.do - do files that submit predicted values.

Output files are included in the Results folder.

I used sav file as raw data and converted it to dta format.

I thank Ryota Mugiyama for sharing his syntax for occulational classification and Tokio Yasuda for using his syntax to creat person years data.
